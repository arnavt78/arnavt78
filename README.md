## ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

My name is Arnav, I've been coding ever since I was eight years old and have made many websites and computer-based projects in my time as a hobby developer. So far my biggest project is [BubbleOS](https://github.com/Bubble-OS/bubbleos), which has over 6000 lines of code and took several months to make! I mainly code in JavaScript and web technologies, as well as Node.js, but I also sometimes code in Rust and C++/Unity.
